  abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

  abstract = {Coral resilience is important for withstanding ecological disturbances as well as anthropogenic changes to the environment. However, the last several decades have demonstrated a decline in resilience that has often resulted in phase shifts to a degraded coral-depleted state with high levels of algal abundance. A major defining issue in current research is to identify when and how it is possible to reverse these phase shifts allowing for the ecosystem to escape coral depletion and maintain coral-based ecosystem services. We extend an analytic model to focus on the effects of over-harvesting of herbivorous reef fish in the Caribbean by explicitly including grazer dynamics which introduces feedbacks between habitat and grazer abundance posing constraints on management options excluded in previous studies. This allows us to develop ecosystem-based management recommendations for two distinct scenarios of coral reef recovery: The first follows significant habitat damage in response to a large disturbance and the second maintains reef structure but has suffered from events such as coral bleaching. We identify critical fishing effort levels to allow for coral recovery and demonstrate that regions exhibiting severe damage to reef structure have little resilience implying that fishing reductions should be coupled with other restoration methods. Regions that are coral-depleted but maintain reef structure allow for recovery given sufficiently small levels of fishing mortality. However, we demonstrate the difference in recovery time in response to varying levels of control efforts on fishing.},

  abstract = {The advent of an ecosystem-based approach dramatically expanded the scope of fisheries management, creating a critical need for new kinds of data and quantitative approaches that could be integrated into the management system. Ecosystem models are needed to codify the relationships among drivers, pressures and resulting states, and to quantify the trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Incorporating ecosystem considerations requires moving from the single-species models used in stock assessments, to more complex models that include species interactions, environmental drivers and human consequences. With this increasing model complexity, model fit can improve, but parameter uncertainty increases. At intermediate levels of complexity, there is a ‘sweet spot’ at which the uncertainty in policy indicators is at a minimum. Finding the sweet spot in models requires compromises: for example, to include additional component species, the models of each species have in some cases been simplified from age-structured to logistic or bioenergetic models. In this paper, we illuminate the characteristics, capabilities and short-comings of the various modelling approaches being proposed for ecosystem-based fisheries management. We identify key ecosystem needs in fisheries management and indicate which types of models can meet these needs. Ecosystem models have been playing strategic roles by providing an ecosystem context for single-species management decisions. However, conventional stock assessments are being increasingly challenged by changing natural mortality rates and environmentally driven changes in productivity that are observed in many fish stocks. Thus, there is a need for more tactical ecosystem models that can respond dynamically to changing ecological and environmental conditions.},

Because fisheries constitute only one of many anthropogenic effects, management is shifting from single-species approaches toward ecosystem-based management. Interaction webs are a critical nexus to understand linkages, to model ecosystem change, and to apply management directives. Ecosystem-based management requires consideration of both direct and indirect effects of commercial fisheries. But it must also include impacts of bycatch, recreational fisheries, artisanal fisheries, and environmental change that can be large but unanticipated. Synergistic effects of fishing, environmental variation, and climate change increasingly threaten marine ecosystems and complicate management. Here we review the global effects of fisheries and propose an integrated framework for managing biophysical processes and human ecology. To incorporate the multitude of effects, this emerging approach focuses on the dynamics of interaction webs in a spatially explicit or place-based framework.},

  abstract = {Data collected over 7 consecutive years were used to examine the population dynamics of the exploited brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis of Meach Lake in central Ontario. Numbers of age-1 and older trout averaged 975 among years. The largest trout were 490 mm long and weighed 1,807 g. Few trout lived beyond age 4. Annual mortality rates varied among age-classes and between sexes; average total instantaneous mortality was 0.95 and average total and fishing mortalities were 78\% and 44\%, respectively. Exploitation was greatest for age-2 and age-3 brook trout of both sexes. Catchability was uncorrelated with abundance. There was evidence of density-dependent growth at age-2 or age-3 but no indication of density-dependent mortality. A “hockey stick” model appeared to best describe the stock–recruitment relationship. Abundance of potential competitors was not correlated with brook trout size, although abundance of white suckers Catostomus commersoni was correlated with numbers of age-2 male brook trout. We conclude that total mortality rates are naturally very high and existing levels of harvests in this lake may not be increasing total mortality. To ensure the sustainability of brook trout fisheries, lake-dwelling populations should be managed to maintain total mortality rates below those observed in this study.},

  abstract = {Removal of large predatory fishes from marine ecosystems has resulted in persistent ecosystem shifts, with collapsed predator populations and super-abundant prey populations. One explanation for these shifts is reversals of predator–prey roles that generate internal feedbacks in the ecosystems. Pelagic forage fish are often predators and competitors to the young life stages of their larger fish predators. I show that cod recruitment in the North Sea has been negatively related to the spawning-stock biomass of herring for the last 44 years. Herring, together with the abundance of Calanus finmarchicus, the major food for cod larvae, were the main predictors of cod recruitment. These predictors were of equivalent importance, worked additively, and explained different parts of the dynamics in cod recruitment. I suggest that intensive harvesting of cod has released herring from predator control, and that a large population of herring suppresses cod recruitment through predation on eggs and larvae. This feedback mechanism can promote alternative stable states and therefore cause hysteresis to occur under changing conditions; however, harvesting of herring might at present prevent a shift in the ecosystem to a herring-dominated state.},

  abstract = {Many marine ecosystems have undergone ‘regime shifts’, i.e. abrupt reorganizations across trophic levels. Establishing whether these constitute shifts between alternative stable states is of key importance for the prospects of ecosystem recovery and for management. We show how mechanisms underlying alternative stable states caused by predator–prey interactions can be revealed in field data, using analyses guided by theory on size-structured community dynamics. This is done by combining data on individual performance (such as growth and fecundity) with information on population size and prey availability. We use Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and their prey in the Baltic Sea as an example to discuss and distinguish two types of mechanisms, ‘cultivation-depensation’ and ‘overcompensation’, that can cause alternative stable states preventing the recovery of overexploited piscivorous fish populations. Importantly, the type of mechanism can be inferred already from changes in the predators' body growth in different life stages. Our approach can thus be readily applied to monitored stocks of piscivorous fish species, for which this information often can be assembled. Using this tool can help resolve the causes of catastrophic collapses in marine predatory–prey systems and guide fisheries managers on how to successfully restore collapsed piscivorous fish stocks.},

We outline the application of these strategies to freshwater recreational fisheries management using a case study in Wisconsin, USA, where black bass (Micropterus spp.) populations are increasing, while Walleye (Sander vitreus) populations are decreasing. Managing for heterogeneity in functional groups (e.g., age classes and prey species of sport fishes), fishery objectives, and regulations can increase resilience, although heterogeneity must be balanced with replication to facilitate learning. Monitoring designed to evaluate management objectives and inform about critical uncertainties, when combined with heterogeneity, creates opportunities for adaptive management, another critical resilience strategy. Although barriers exist to implementing resilience strategies, management designed to accommodate uncertainty and illuminate its consequences is needed to maintain critical fisheries in a rapidly changing world.},

  abstract = {To predict recreational-fishing impacts on freshwater fish species, it is important to understand the interplay between fish populations, anglers and management actions. We use an integrated bioeconomic model to study the importance of fish life-history type (LHT) for determining (i) vulnerability to over-exploitation by diverse angler types (generic, consumptive and trophy anglers), who respond dynamically to fishing-quality changes; (ii) regulations [i.e., minimum-size limits (MSLs) and licence densities] that maximize the social welfare of angler populations; and (iii) biological and social conditions resulting under such socially optimal regulations. We examine five prototypical freshwater species: European perch (Perca fluviatilis), brown trout (Salmo trutta), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), pike (Esox lucius) and bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus). We find that LHT is important for determining the vulnerability of fish populations to overfishing, with pike, pikeperch, and bull trout being more vulnerable than perch and brown trout. Angler type influences the magnitude of fishing impacts, because of differences in fishing practices and angler-type-specific effects of LHT on angling effort. Our results indicate that angler types are systematically attracted to particular LHTs. Socially optimal minimum-size limits generally increase with LHT vulnerability, whereas optimal licence densities are similar across LHTs. Yet, both regulations vary among angler types. Despite this variation, we find that biological sustainability occurs under socially optimal regulations, with one exception. Our results highlight the importance of jointly considering fish diversity, angler diversity and regulations when predicting sustainable management strategies for recreational fisheries. Failure to do so could result in socially suboptimal management and/or fishery collapse.},

To date, operationalizing these attempts to provide tactical advice has met with limited success.

Accounting for regime shifts in management clearly requires integrative, ecosystem-based management (EBM) approaches. EBM has emerged as an accepted paradigm for ocean management worldwide, yet, despite the rapid and intense development of EBM theory, implementation has languished, and many implemented or proposed EBM schemes largely ignore the special characteristics of regime shifts. Here, we first explore key aspects of regime shifts that are of critical importance to EBM, and then suggest how regime shifts can be better incorporated into EBM using the concept of integrated ecosystem assessment (IEA). An IEA uses approaches that determine the likelihood that ecological or socio-economic properties of systems will move beyond or return to acceptable bounds as defined by resource managers and policy makers. We suggest an approach for implementing IEAs for cases of regime shifts where the objectives are either avoiding an undesired state or returning to a desired condition. We discuss the suitability and short-comings of methods summarizing the status of ecosystem components, screening and prioritizing potential risks, and evaluating alternative management strategies. IEAs are evolving as an EBM approach that can address regime shifts; however, advances in statistical, analytical and simulation modelling are needed before IEAs can robustly inform tactical management in systems characterized by regime shifts.},

This paper discusses angling patterns within a framework of basic ecological and evolutionary literature and examines potential biological impacts of angling by focusing on study results associated with high exploitation rates and pronounced selective exploitation. The impacts range from impacts occurring directly on the exploited species (truncation of the natural age and size structure, depensatory mechanisms, loss of genetic variability, evolutionary changes), to those that occur on the aquatic ecosystem (changes in trophic cascades, trait-mediated effects). As a third category, impacts related to the angling activity per se are distinguished (habitat modifications, wildlife disturbance, nutrient inputs, loss of fishing gear). Although the main threats to fish often are localized outside recreational fisheries, there is growing evidence that angling and angling associated activities can lead to a decline of fish populations and affect aquatic ecosystems in various ways provided that the degree of the fishing mortality is high and the selective exploitation is intensive. In conclusion, management implications for sustainable recreational fisheries and areas for future research are outlined.},

  abstract = {Early warning signals (EWS) might dramatically improve our ability to manage nonlinear ecological change. However, the degree to which theoretical EWS predictions are supported in empirical systems remains unclear. The goal of this study is to make recommendations for identifying the types of ecological transitions that are expected to show EWS. We conducted a review and meta-analysis of published studies and comparative analysis of eight northeast Pacific Ocean time series to illustrate the importance of testing for nonlinearity in empirical EWS studies. We found that published studies demonstrating nonlinearity in ecosystem dynamics are more likely to support EWS predictions than studies with linear or undetermined dynamics. The northeast Pacific time series in our analysis were often too short for formal tests of nonlinearity, a common problem in empirical studies. To assess the evidence for nonlinear dynamics in these data, we tested for state-dependent driver–response relationships consistent with hysteresis, a central feature of nonlinear ecological models. This analysis supported the results of the literature meta-analysis. Four time series with driver–response relationships consistent with hysteresis generally supported theoretical EWS predictions, while four without evidence of hysteresis failed to support EWS predictions. Theoretical support for EWS is largely generated from nonlinear models, and we conclude that tests for either nonlinear dynamics or hysteresis are needed before employing EWS.},

We review recent research regarding the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on freshwater ecosystems and the severity of their undesirable effects on ecosystem processes and services. Appropriate management strategies are needed to mitigate the long-term or irreversible losses of ecosystem services caused by climate change. To address this, this review puts forward a threshold-based management framework as a potential platform for scientists, decision makers and stakeholders of freshwater ecosystems to work together in reducing risks from climate change. In this framework, the susceptibility of local freshwater ecosystems to change beyond thresholds is continuously investigated and updated by scientists, used to design policy targets by decision makers, and used to establish mitigation measures by local stakeholders.},

  abstract = {Observed ecosystem responses to fisheries management experiments have often been either much smaller or in the opposite direction of the expected responses based on experience or population models. Examples of these responses can be found even for some very simple experimental management manipulations such as predator and prey manipulations in small lakes and ponds to fish population responses to harvest closures. Such counter-intuitive prediction failures offer opportunities to identify key processes and variables that are not widely considered in models used to evaluate ecosystem-based fisheries management policies. A common denominator in the case histories presented are unexpected behavioral responses and strong changes in juvenile survival rates of fish driven by changes in competition, predation, and behavioral responses to predation risk. These factors restructured many of the ecosystems in our simple examples, yet are not widely included in models currently used to evaluate ecosystem-based fisheries management policies. This represents a critical need in the development of modeling tools to evaluate ecosystem-based policies based on an iterative process of model building and model testing, using fisheries management actions as probing tools to learn more about the ecosystems being managed.},

This determination is difficult because a high recruitment, when the stock is at a low level of abundance (or vice versa), may be the indication of the onset of a multidecadal regime shift, or just a chance occurrence. Accordingly, the determination of an increase or decrease in productivity from observations independent of those made directly on fish populations is important.},

Nature is usually assumed to respond to gradual change in a smooth way. However, studies on lakes, coral reefs, oceans, forests and arid lands have shown that smooth change can be interrupted by sudden drastic switches to a contrasting state. Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},
