# Abstract

# Introduction
Ecosystem-based management
Shown to increase system resilience 
  May be useful in systems where linear management is not effect (Pine et al., 2009) 
Management of systems that exhibit hysteresis
  Commercial fisheries examples 
  Single species examples 
This model 
The goal of this study is:
  (1) to understand the role hysteresis plays in both the type and magnitude of management responses necessary to maintain a system in a desired configuration. 
  (2) to investigate the role management responses can play in reverting to an alternative configuration. 
We do this by: 
  Modeling species-specific responses to regulations and stocking
  Consideration of optimal strategy and magnitude to maintain system in a desired state
  With and without hysteresis 
  Consideration of optimal strategy and magnitude to change system state. 
  Also with and without hysteresis

# Methods

Base model (reference Q1 manuscript)
Stocking 
Management (species specific) 
How we got hysteresis in the system  

## Simulation Space  
Optimal management scenarios
